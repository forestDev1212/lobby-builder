## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously — and we appreciate your help keeping `Memeliza` safe for everyone.

If you discover a vulnerability:

- Include as much detail as possible (e.g. reproduction steps, impact, proposed fix).
- The team will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**, and respond with next steps shortly after.

Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities until we’ve reviewed and addressed them.

## 📣 Disclosure Process

Once a report is received:

1. A core maintainer is assigned as the handler.
2. The issue is confirmed and a fix is prepared for supported versions.
3. The team audits related parts of the codebase for similar issues.
4. A patch is released as soon as possible and details are disclosed responsibly.

We aim to be transparent and collaborative through the entire process.
